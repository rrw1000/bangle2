# rrw's bangle.js app(s)

This repo is a bit unformed at the moment - turns out my Mac doesn't have
BTLE, so I can't use the actual bangle and am cutting + pasting in the
emulator.

It'll get better when (if?) I finish it and make it a proper app..

I'd really like to use typescript here, but I'm scared that if I let
the ts compiler at it, I'll blow my code size limits.

## Using

```
npm run compile
```

will compile code ready for uploading into `build/output.js` for uploading with the Web IDE.
